# Working with lubridate


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2023.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the modern data wrangling workflow with R and lubridate. Time and date data are fundamental in data analysis, and their proper management is crucial for drawing meaningful insights from data. In the R programming language, lubridate is a powerful package that simplifies time and date manipulation. 

### Main learning objectives

The primary objectives of this session are to (1) provide you with a conceptual understanding of the lubridate package and its capabilities in date-time manipulation, (2) introduce you to key lubridate functions, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
